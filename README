Problems:
Gathering mechanical data from external sources (OBD2 interfaces, ADCs, CAN buses, etc).
Saving said data in standard formats.
Displaying only the data the operator needs to see.

Goals:
Modular, open-source dash system targeting Android and potentially other JVM-capable platforms.
Open source, on github.
Leverage code contributions for sensor definitions, front-ends, log file formats, and data-source drivers.

Sub-projects:

source: Data source drivers, such as OBD2 interfaces, ADCs, etc.
controller: Controls how the inputs are streamed to the dash(es) and logger(s). Refresh rates, rolling averages, channel composition, etc. go here.
dash: Handles how things are displayed. The controller tells the display what to show and when, and it does the rest.
ui: The UIs for configuring the system. Potentially one per OS.
logger: Handles saving gathered data to various log file formats.
sensor: Sensor definitions.
