Problems:
Gathering mechanical data from external sources (OBD2 interfaces, ADCs, CAN buses, etc).
Saving said data in standard formats.
Displaying only the data the operator needs to see.

Goals:
Modular, open-source dash system targeting Android and potentially other JVM-capable platforms.
Open source, on github.
Leverage code contributions for sensor definitions, front-ends, log file formats, and data-source drivers.

Projects:

ddaq: The main library. Defines channels, dashes, controllers, sources, etc. and tools to compose them.
source: Data source drivers, such as OBD2 interfaces, ADCs, etc.
controller: Controls dashes and loggers. Channel composition, warnings, rolling averages, etc.
logger: Handles saving gathered data to various log file formats.
sensor: Sensor definitions.

Platforms:

test: The development test platform. Prints output to System.out.
android: The first target platform.
